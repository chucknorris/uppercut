DESCRIPTION

ReportGenerator converts XML reports generated by PartCover, OpenCover
or NCover into a readable HTML report. 
In contrast to the XSLT-Transformation included in PartCover, the 
report is more detailed.
It does not only show the coverage quota, but also includes the source 
code and visualizes which line has been covered.

ReportGenerator supports merging several reports into one.
If you pass several reports to ReportGenerator, the reports will be
merged into one.
It is also possible to pass one XML file containing several reports to
ReportGenerator (e.g. a build log file).

Several output formats are supported by ReportGenerator. The following
report types can be generated:

-HTML, HTMLSummary
-XML, XMLSummary
-Latex, LatexSummary

Compatibility:

OpenCover
PartCover 4.0
PartCover 2.2, 2.3
NCover (tested version 1.5.8, other versions may not work)

Also available as NuGet package:
